For my final project, I want to make an art application, where the user can use a pen of different widths and colors to create a drawing.  It will be a simpler version of PaintTool SAI and MediBang Paint Pro as it will have fewer functionalities.  Some differences will be that you will not be able to create layers for a single piece as you can in either of the aforementioned professional digital art apps, change brushes, or be able to use perspective guides.  

Here is the full list of functionalities that I want to make sure that my artboard can do by the end of the semester:  
- Use a slider bar to determine the thickness of a pen/eraser  
- Use a slider bar or a color ramp to determine the color of the pen  
- Create an eraser to fix mistakes in the piece  
- Use Ctrl Z to undo strokes, so each stroke should be stored in a stack  
- Make sure that the lines/strokes are as smooth as possible  

Once I achieve those functionalities, I will work towards trying to implement the next few, though they are more towards the optional side:  
- Set the color of the pen using a color finder function   
- Affect the contrast and quality/color density of the entire picture  
- Change the saturation of a particular color prior to using the specific pen  
- Create multiple pens  
- Be able to set the background color of the canvas  

I will need the following libraries that were already installed:
- ofxVectorGraphics  
- ofxGUI  

These are some additional libraries I found on the ofx site that were created by other people.  I am not completely sure if I will need all of them, or need different ones as I do not know all of these librariesâ€™ functionalities or whether there are any overlaps as of now:
- ofxColorFinder    
- ofxColorGradient  
- ofxColorRamp  
- ofxColorQuantizer  
- ofxContrast  
- ofxDmtrUI3  
- ofxShivaVG  

Although I do not have much experience with UI, I have been using MediBang Paint Pro for the past few years.  I know what kinds of designs and features I want to implement in my art app and will create it based on the features that I have used in MediBang.
