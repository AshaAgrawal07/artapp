For my final project, I want to make an art application, where the user can use a pen of different widths and colors to create a drawing.  It will be a simpler version of PaintTool SAI and MediBang Paint Pro as it will have fewer functionalities.  Some differences will be that you will not be able to create layers for a single piece as you can in either of the aforementioned professional digital art apps, change brushes, or be able to use perspective guides.  Also, the entire drawing will be in a single color and pen thickness.

Here is the full list of functionalities that I want to make sure that my artboard can do by the end of the semester:  
- Use a slider bar to determine the thickness of a pen  
- Use a slider bar or a color ramp to determine the color of the pen  
- Affect the contrast and quality/color density of the entire picture  
- Use 'Z' to undo strokes, so each stroke should be stored in a stack  
- Save the GUI settings before exiting (which will load the next time app is opened)  
- Save the drawing as a '.jpg'  

Ways to expand on this project:  
- Set the color of the pen using a color finder function   
- Change the saturation of a particular color prior to using the specific pen  
- Create multiple pens  
- Create an eraser to fix mistakes in the piece  
- Be able to set the background color of the canvas  
- Make sure that the lines/strokes are as smooth as possible  

I will need the following libraries that were already installed and will be used for the functionalities that I want to achieve by the end of the semester:  
- ofxVectorGraphics  
- ofxGUI  

These are some additional libraries I found on the ofx site that were created by other people.  These will probably be handy when I expand on the project later on:  
- ofxColorFinder   
- ofxColorQuantizer  
- ofxContrast  
- ofxDmtrUI3  

Although I do not have much experience with UI, I have been using MediBang Paint Pro for the past few years.  I know what kinds of designs and features I want to implement in my art app and will create it based on the features that I have used in MediBang.
