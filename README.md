**WALLPAPER CREATOR**  
--------  
In this application, you can create a drawing with a single stroke color and thickness on a black background.  Resulting drawings can be saved as a .jpg and used as wallpapers.  

**To Build and Use**  
Make sure you have Visual Studio's openFrameworks working on your computer.  You can build the app directly from there.  To use the app, draw whatever you want and control the thickness and color of the strokes using the GUI panel on the upper left side of the pop-up window.  
Keys you can use:  
'Z' = deleting previous stroke  
'H' = hiding the GUI panel  
'S' = saves the current GUI panel setting and saves your drawing  

There is a toggle button for pen/eraser there as well, but has not been fully implemented.  It will be working in the near future.  Also, there will be a few other functionalities that will be added later on, including setting your own background color, letting each stroke be independent in its thickness and color, and having a color picker.
